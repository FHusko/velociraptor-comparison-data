"""
Usage:
  convert.py [--nproc NPROC]

where NPROC is the number of parallel processes used to run conversion scripts.

This script will run all the conversion scripts found in the data directory:
  data/*/conversion/*.py
Every script is run as follows:
  python3 $script_name ../../../cosmology.py
using the script's conversion directory as working directory.

To allow for efficient parallel execution, the script first creates a list of
all the scripts that need to be run. It then creates NPROC slots and launches
a subprocess running a script in each slot (or until there are no more scripts
to run). As soon as a subprocess slot finishes, a next script is launched in
the same slot, until all scripts have been processed.

Based on an earlier bash script that processed scripts serially.
