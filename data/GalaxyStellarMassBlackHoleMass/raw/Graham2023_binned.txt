# Binned median galaxy stellar masses and black hole masses from Graham & Sahu (2023) (2023MNRAS.518.2177G).
# The BH masses for different morphological types are weighted by using fractions of those morphological
# types as a function of stellar mass from Moffet et al. (2016) (2016MNRAS.462.4336M).
# log10(M_star) log10(M_star_16) log10(M_star_84) log10(M_BH/M_star) log10(M_BH/M_star)_16 log10(M_BH/M_star)_84
